Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.

When reviewing a website portfolio for a candidate applying for an intern position focused on computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, there are several key elements I would like to see. Here is a list of those elements with a brief explanation for each:

1. Projects: A portfolio should showcase the candidate's past projects related to computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. Each project should include a description, the problem statement, the approach taken, and the results achieved.

2. Code Samples: Including code samples from the candidate's projects is essential. It allows me to assess their coding skills, understanding of algorithms, and their ability to implement machine learning models.

3. Results and Metrics: Demonstrating the impact and outcomes of the candidate's projects is crucial. Including metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other relevant performance measures, helps evaluate the effectiveness of their work.

4. Data Visualization: Presenting visualizations of the results and data analysis can provide insights into the candidate's ability to effectively communicate findings. It shows their proficiency in using libraries like Matplotlib, seaborn, or other visualization tools.

5. Technical Skills: A section highlighting the candidate's technical skills related to computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning is important. It can include programming languages (e.g., Python, C++), frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), libraries (e.g., OpenCV), and any other relevant tools.

6. Academic Background: Including information about the candidate's academic background, such as relevant coursework, research projects, or published papers, can help assess their theoretical knowledge and understanding of core concepts.

7. Teamwork and Collaboration: If the candidate has experience working in a team or contributing to open-source projects, it is valuable to highlight this. It shows their ability to collaborate, communicate, and work effectively in a group setting.

8. Problem-Solving Approach: A brief explanation of the candidate's problem-solving approach, methodologies, and any unique techniques they have employed can provide insights into their critical thinking abilities.

9. Impact and Innovation: If the candidate's projects have resulted in significant impact or showcased innovative approaches, it is essential to highlight these aspects. This demonstrates their ability to think creatively and make a meaningful contribution.

10. Personal Touch: Including a personal statement or introduction can give a glimpse into the candidate's passion, motivation, and enthusiasm for computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. It helps create a connection between the candidate and the recruiter.

Remember, these are just key elements that I would typically look for in a portfolio. The specific requirements and preferences may vary depending on the company and the position.
